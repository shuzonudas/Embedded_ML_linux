# Embedded Machine Learning Audio Classification on Linux

A robust, edge-optimized machine learning pipeline deployed on remote Linux audio-recorders to test and evaluate acoustic models in real-world environments. This application continuously processes audio recordings to identify specific acoustic signatures (such as chainsaw sounds), localizes events in time, generates detailed batch CSV reports, and automatically archives positive and negative sample classifications for ongoing quality assessment.

## Key Features

* **Remote Edge Deployment:** Designed to run seamlessly on headless Linux audio monitoring hardware for field-testing ML model accuracy.
* **Batch Audio Scanning:** Processes directories of audio recordings automatically to check for target sound events.
* **Temporal Localization:** Identifies exact **start and end times** for detected audio events within each file.
* **Confidence Scoring:** Outputs probability percentages estimating the likelihood of a positive match.
* **Automated CSV Reporting:** Exports a structured summary containing file names, detection percentages, and precise timestamps.
* **Sample Archiving (`saved_samples`):** Automatically saves positive and negative inference outputs to dedicated directories for verification and model fine-tuning.
